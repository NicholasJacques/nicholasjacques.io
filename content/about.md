I am a software developer in based in Denver, CO, who decided to turn my lifelong hobby of tinkering with computers into a fulfilling career. With an extensive background in management and leadership, I pride myself on my ability to foster collaborative working environments that consistently produce excellent results. I love diving deep into challenging problems and approach solving them by relentlessly distilling them to their root cause in order to ensure a focused, actionable solution. Entrepreneurial at heart, I love dreaming up and protyping new products that solve real world issues. When I'm not progamming I spend as much time as possible enjoying the outdoors. Most weekends you can find me sleeping under the stars somewhere in the Rocky Mountains.
