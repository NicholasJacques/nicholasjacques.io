Hi, my name is Nick.

I am a software developer based in Denver, Colorado.

Before becoming a software developer I renovated people's homes.

Before that I managed restaurants.

I like to make things and solve problems.

I enjoy sharing my learning and absorbing knowledge from others.

I'm pretty good at programming with Ruby.

I'm getting better at programming with JavaScript.

I'm a back-end developer at heart; but I sure like things that look nice.

On the weekends you can probably find me sleeping under the stars, somewhere in the Rocky Mountains.
